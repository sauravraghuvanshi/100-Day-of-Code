# 100-Day-of-Code
In this repository, I am going to share my 100 days of my code track. It will help start coding from basics and then moving towards more complex problem using c++.

# C++ Basics:-

## Day-1:-

### Theory
* Created C and C++ Compiler Environment by installing Vs Code
* Learned few fundamental concepts of C++

## Day-2:-

### Theory
* C++ Introduction
* Feature of C++
### Program
* 2.1 My first C++ program

## Day-3:-

### Theory
* Void main() vs main()
* **C++ Data Types:-**
  1. Primary Data Types:-
     * Integer 
     * Character
     * Boolean
     * Floating Point
     * Double Floating Point
     * void
     * Wide Character

   2. Derived Data Types:-
      * Function
      * Array
      * Pointer
      * References

   3. User Defined:-
      * Class
      * Structure
      * Union
      * Enum
      * Typedef

## Day-4:-

### Theory:-
* **Basic Input/Output in C++:-**
  * Input Stream
  * Output Stream
* **Header Files available in C++ for Input/Output:-**
  * iostream(Standart input/Output  Stream)
  * iomanip(Input/Output Manipulators)
  * fstream(for file stream)
* **Object defined in the header file iostream like the cin and cout:-**
  * Standard Output stream(cout)
  * Standard Input stream(cin)
  * Un-buffered standard error stream(cerr)
  * Buffered-stanadard error stream(clog) 

### Program:-
* 4.1 Standard output stream (cout).cpp
* 4.2 standard input stream (cin).cpp

* Working of Preprocessor
* What is preprocessor directive
* **There are 4 types of preprocessor directive:-**
  * Macros
  * File Inclusion
  * Conditional Compilation
  * other directives
* Studied about Macros

### Program:-
* 5.1 Macros.cpp
* 5.2_Macro_with_Argument.cpp

## Day-6:-

### Theory:-
* Operators in C++
* Loops
